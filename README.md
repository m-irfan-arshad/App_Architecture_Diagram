# AI Mobile Architecture Documentation

This repository contains architectural documentation and design patterns for AI-first mobile applications.

## Contents

- [Main Architecture Documentation](ai_first_app_arch_main.md) - Core architectural principles and overview
- [Security Layer](ai_first_app_arch_layer.md) - Security architecture and considerations
- [Integration Patterns](AI_Mobile_Integration_Patterns.md) - Patterns for integrating AI capabilities
- [Architecture Diagrams](AI_Mobile_Architecture_Main.puml) - PlantUML diagrams of the architecture

## Overview

This documentation provides guidance for building mobile applications with AI capabilities as first-class features. It covers:

- Architectural principles for AI-first mobile apps
- Security considerations and implementation
- Integration patterns for AI services
- Detailed architecture diagrams and flows

## Getting Started

1. Start with the [main architecture document](ai_first_app_arch_main.md) for an overview
2. Review the [integration patterns](AI_Mobile_Integration_Patterns.md) for AI service implementation
3. Consult the [security layer documentation](ai_first_app_arch_layer.md) for security best practices
4. Reference the [architecture diagrams](AI_Mobile_Architecture_Main.puml) for visual representations
